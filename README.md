# npma-33-form-generator
This a form generator for Pest Control Document NPMA-33, also known as the "Wood Destroying Insect Inspection Report".

This was a project to work with vanilla javascript, dom and the jsPDF Library provided by @MrRio.
You can find the original Library at https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF.

This was a fun project as it allowed me to take on a normal PDF file, convert it into a base64 JPEG and output another pdf, that was edited with new content. The possibilities are endless. There will be more to come with this generator soon, as the css and REGEX have not properly been introduced.

If you have any question feel free to contract me at matthewesparza12@gmail.com
